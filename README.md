# kerneldev
Start by running `./mkfs.sh` in this directory.
This will download and build busybox, and create the fs-root folder.
It will also make an init script and make it executable, you can change this script in the file.

Make sure you have built a kernel bzImage, and pass it as an argument to `launch.sh`.
